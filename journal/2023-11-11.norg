* Static evaluation
  The downside of splitting these two up is that we're doing a bunch of work
  twice: We're computing the endgame score twice, we're computing each
  individual piece's bitmap twice, etc...

  Combining them would save us a bunch of cycles, for sure.

** Material scoring
   Use Pesto's midgame and endgame values

** Positional scoring
