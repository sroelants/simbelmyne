### What's new

This release mostly focuses on improving the search. Simbelmyne prunes much more
accurately (and aggresively!), and the average branching factor across the
bench suite has dropped significantly.

A small gauntlet puts it at ~2900 Elo, around 233 Elo stronger than Simbelmyne
v1.6.0

### Choosing a binary
This release comes with precompiled binaries for all major platforms. Because
the engine benefits tremendously from more modern CPU instruction sets, there 
are binaries compiled for major instruction sets, following the x86-64 
[microarchitecture levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels) 
as a naming scheme. 

Realistically, on modern hardware (< 10 years old), you should be okay to use the 
binaries labeled `V3`. If the engine crashes within the first seconds, try `V2`, 
and so on.
