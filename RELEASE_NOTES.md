### What's new
This version mostly focuses on search tweaks. Most every tweak I could get to
gain has been included, so I imagine we're getting into diminishing returns and
~5 Elo patches.

Simbelmyne 1.8 is around 180 Elo stronger than 1.7 in STC self-play.
A small gauntlet places Simbelmyne at around 3050 Blitz üéâ

### Choosing a binary
This release comes with precompiled binaries for all major platforms. Because
the engine benefits tremendously from more modern CPU instruction sets, there 
are binaries compiled for major instruction sets, following the x86-64 
[microarchitecture levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels) 
as a naming scheme. 

Realistically, on modern hardware (< 10 years old), you should be okay to use the 
binaries labeled `V3`. If the engine crashes within the first seconds, try `V2`, 
and so on.
