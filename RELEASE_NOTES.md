### What's new
Version 1.10 is a pretty huge grab-bag of changes. Lots of re-factors that make 
the codebase easier to maintain, a lot of search improvements, and &mdash; for 
the first time in several versions &mdash; a big round of improvements to the
evaluation function. I think Simbelmyne is slowly but surely getting to the 
point where a NNUE-based evaluation becomes inevitable, but let's see how far 
we can take her, first!

No gauntlet just yet, so I don't have a very accurate guess at the playing
strength, but self play tests say [+215 STC](https://chess.samroelants.com/test/354/) and [+200 LTC](https://chess.samroelants.com/test/355/).

### Choosing a binary
This release comes with precompiled binaries for all major platforms. Because
the engine benefits tremendously from more modern CPU instruction sets, there 
are binaries compiled for major instruction sets, following the x86-64 
[microarchitecture levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels) 
as a naming scheme. 

Realistically, on modern hardware (< 10 years old), you should be okay to use the 
binaries labeled `V3`. If the engine crashes within the first seconds, try `V2`, 
and so on.
